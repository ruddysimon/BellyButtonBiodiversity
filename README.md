# BellyButtonBiodiversity
In this project, we build an interactive dashboard using Plotly.js to explore [Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/).

# Project Overview
* Create a PIE chart that uses data from your samples route (`/samples/<sample>`) to display the top 10 samples.
* Create a Bubble Chart that uses data from your samples route (`/samples/<sample>`) to display each sample.
* Display the sample metadata from the route `/metadata/<sample>`
* Adapt the Gauge Chart from <https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/> to plot the Weekly Washing Frequency obtained from the `/metadata/<sample>`route.
